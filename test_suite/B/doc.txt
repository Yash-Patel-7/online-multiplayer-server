Tests:	game-level errors

These testcases test how the server handles:
1.	Client trying to move to an already occupied space
2.	Client trying to move a space out of bounds
3.	Client trying to move for the opponent
4.	Invalid format inputted by the client

In all cases, the server will send an INVL message and allow the client to correct itself.

Tests:	Application-level errors, such as sending an unexpected message (e.g., sending PLAY at any time after the first
		message, or the client sending MOVD)

These testcases test how the server handles:
1.	A PLAY message received after a PLAY message was already received
		a.	messages sent by the client at inappropiate times
2.	A message received that would have been sent by the server
		a.	the client is sending messages that should only be sent by the server

In all cases, the server will send an INVL message and allow the client to correct itself.

Tests:	Presentation-level errors, such as sending a message with the wrong number of fields or where the message length does
		not match the stated length, or sending data that cannot be interpreted as a message at all

These testcases test how the server handles:
1.	Excess fields in a message sent by the client
2.	Lack of fields in a message sent by the client
3.	An incorrect stated length compared to the message length
4.	Gibberish messages that do not mean anything to the server

In all cases, the server will send an INVL message and close the connection. The server will not crash or perform unexpected
behavior.
